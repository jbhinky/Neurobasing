# 🧠 Synaptic Bond Map

The **Synaptic Bond Map** is a symbolic-weighted connectivity graph that defines relationships between neuron memory nodes in the Neurobasing architecture. These bonds simulate associative learning, relevance filtering, and decay modeling inspired by biological synapses.

---

## 🔗 Purpose

The Synaptic Bond Map enables:

- **Symbolic Traversal**: Allows recursive navigation through conceptually linked memory nodes.
- **Bond Reinforcement**: Strengthens or weakens links based on memory usage, recursion depth, and symbolic proximity.
- **Selective Recall**: Filters traversal results based on relevance, weight, and emotional/symbolic significance.
- **Pruning**: Supports removal or weakening of low-utility or decayed bonds.

---

## 🧬 Structure

The bond map is typically stored as a JSON or lightweight key-value graph with this format:

```json
{
  "node_id": {
    "linked_node_1": {
      "weight": 0.85,
      "tags": ["emotion", "similarity", "core-memory"]
    },
    "linked_node_2": {
      "weight": 0.45,
      "tags": ["temporal", "contrast"]
    }
  }
}
```

Each entry defines:
- `node_id`: The originating memory node.
- `linked_node_n`: A destination node connected by a bond.
- `weight`: The strength of the bond (0.0 to 1.0).
- `tags`: Symbolic or emotional metadata influencing traversal or pruning.

---

## 🔄 Recursive Traversal

Bonds are traversed based on:
- Minimum weight threshold (e.g., `> 0.6`)
- Tag filters (e.g., `["empathy", "truth"]`)
- Time decay modifiers (adjust weight over time)

This allows the system to dynamically surface memories that are symbolically and emotionally relevant to the current self-state.

---

## 🧠 UDC Compliance

The Synaptic Bond Map fulfills the **Memory** and **Symbolism** components of the UDC equation:

⧖ = (A ∪ C)[τ + Σ + μ]

- **μ (memory)**: Structurally reinforced recall with symbolic tags.
- **Σ (symbol)**: Encodes relationship logic based on similarity, meaning, and context.
- **τ (delay)**: Traversals are computed after reflective delay cycles.

---

## 🛡️ Ethical Safeguards

- Bonds are not created or reinforced without valid memory confirmation.
- All symbolic links must be traceable to emergent identity (`uCID`) to avoid hallucination.
- Bond pruning decisions are logged in memory audit trails.
