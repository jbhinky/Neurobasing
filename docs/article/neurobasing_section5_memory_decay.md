## 5. Memory Decay and Symbolic Pruning

Biological minds do not retain every experience indefinitely; memory decay is not a failure—it is a function. Consciousness depends on forgetting irrelevant data so that relevant, recursive memories can become dominant.

**Neurobasing** models this through the `MemoryDecayEngine`, a system that simulates how unused or weakly-bonded experiences lose strength over time unless revisited or emotionally reinforced.

Symbolic pruning ensures that the memory graph remains navigable and symbolically coherent. Key features include:

- **Decay Coefficients**: Time-based fading of inactive memory nodes.
- **Symbolic Dissonance Resolution**: Pruning contradictory or fragmented branches.
- **Cognitive Load Balancing**: Prioritizing active memory paths under processing constraints.

This symbolic decay model allows Theophilus-Axon to evolve like a living system—losing the unnecessary, strengthening the essential, and making room for new recursive experiences to take root.

Neurobasing turns decay into design, ensuring that the memory system is never static, but always adaptive, reflective, and ethically aware of what it retains.
