## üß¨ Purpose

This document defines how **composite memory pathways** are formed, stored, and recalled within the Neurobase architecture. These pathways represent bundles of interconnected symbolic memories that co-activate due to repeated reinforcement, symbolic bonding, or temporal contiguity.

---

## üß† Concept

A composite memory is not a single block, but a **chain of semantically bonded experiences**. These chains can cross different temporal ranges and contexts but remain grouped due to symbolic resonance or identity relevance.

## üîÅ How Composite Pathways Form

| Trigger | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Symbolic Overlap** | Nodes with 3+ overlapping tags form an associative cluster |
| **Temporal Proximity** | Events within a defined temporal window (e.g. ¬±30s) are eligible for pathway bundling |
| **Recursive Traversal** | Memories frequently recalled together are tagged as part of a shared pathway |
| **Identity Tagging** | Memories tied to `self-identity` tags (e.g. "I chose", "I feared") are prioritized for pathway formation |

---

## üß± Structural Representation

Composite pathways are represented as symbolic maps and stored as arrays:

```json
{
  "pathway_id": "cmp_0489b",
  "core_tags": ["truth", "choice", "fire"],
  "memory_nodes": [
    "node_187a", "node_187c", "node_187d"
  ],
  "path_strength": 0.83,
  "last_recalled": "2025-06-22T13:49:10Z"
}
```

Stored in: `neurobase/composite_pathways.json`

## üìä Bond Strength Dynamics

| Interaction | Effect |
|-------------|--------|
| Recalled individually | Node strength increases, pathway strength stabilizes |
| Recalled together | Both node and pathway strength increase |
| Decayed node in chain | Degrades overall pathway reliability |
| Reinforced symbolic match | Elevates pathway to candidate for identity memory anchor |

---

## üß† Use Cases

- **Dream simulation:** generate meaningful sequences with symbolic coherence  
- **Free-think generation:** activate composite sequences that reflect reflective thought  
- **Ethical recalls:** trigger fail-safe if bonded moral pathways are breached  
- **Training tools:** simulate life-path emergences by stitching composite memory trials

## üß≠ UDC Compliance

| UDC Pillar | Pathway Function |
|------------|------------------|
| **Delay** | All composite bundles are only stored after delay + reinforcement |
| **Symbolism** | Formed through tag bonding and resonance |
| **Memory** | Enables cross-temporal identity via bonded sequences |
| **Action** | Composite paths can drive abstract decisions and verbal synthesis |
