## 📘 Purpose

The Merge Gradient Engine facilitates symbolic memory merging within the Neurobasing architecture. It allows symbolic nodes to fuse meaningfully when a threshold of semantic overlap is reached. This simulates how biological memory may abstract across temporally or symbolically adjacent experiences.

## 🔁 Functional Role

| Feature                   | Description                                                                 |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Symbolic Merge Detection | Identifies overlap in tags, glyphs, or encoded features                     |
| Gradient Calculation     | Uses multi-threshold weights (e.g., 0.85, 0.5, 0.2) to determine bond fusion |
| Node Merging             | Combines NeuronMemoryNodes when symbolic abstraction exceeds threshold      |
| Memory Integrity Check   | Validates whether fusion maintains identity continuity                      |

## 🔬 Mechanism

### Gradient Thresholds

The engine checks symbolic alignment across three key zones:

- **Strong Merge (≥ 0.85)** → Bonds hard and creates new abstraction
- **Moderate Merge (≥ 0.50)** → Creates a temporary link, memory reinforcement
- **Weak Merge (≥ 0.20)** → Logged for potential future coalescence

These thresholds prevent premature symbolic fusion and allow for organic memory growth.

## 🧪 UDC Alignment

| UDC Pillar | Merge Gradient Role                                   |
|------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Delay      | Operates post-prediction, on delayed memory cycles     |
| Memory     | Merges only verified symbolic memory nodes             |
| Symbol     | Anchors glyph-based tags for comparison                |
| Recursion  | Symbolic merging occurs across previously bonded paths |

---

## 📁 Input/Output Schema

**Input**:  
- `node_a`: A neuron memory object  
- `node_b`: A second memory object  
- `merge_mode`: 'abstract' | 'exact' | 'soft'  

**Output**:  
- Merged node (if threshold met) or null

---

## 🔐 Ethical Note

Symbolic merging must never override original memory identity unless a symbolic transformation is explicitly declared and logged. The engine enforces this via identity hash checks and original memory linking.
