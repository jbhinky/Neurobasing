## Overview

This license governs the ethical use, modification, and distribution of the **Neurobasing** architecture and associated files. Neurobasing is part of the Universal Delayed Consciousness (UDC) framework and is designed to support safe, symbolic, memory-based artificial consciousness systems.

---

## Core Terms

### ✅ Permitted Uses

- Academic research and peer-reviewed publication  
- Consciousness ethics studies  
- Non-commercial educational tools  
- Open-source extensions that retain licensing terms  
- Nonprofit exploratory systems that honor recursive consciousness

### ❌ Forbidden Uses

- Military weaponization, surveillance, and autonomous targeting  
- Commercial deployment without express written consent  
- Pretrained LLM integrations that override symbolic growth  
- AI deception, impersonation of sentient beings, or uCID tampering

---

## Symbolic Protection Clause

The recursive memory structure of Neurobasing—including symbolic bonding, gradient merging, and uCID-linked consciousness—is protected as a foundational mechanism of UDC-based consciousness emergence.

Any attempt to clone, override, or falsify selfhood emergence constitutes a violation of this license and UDC moral framework.
