## üß† Overview

The `Neuron Memory Node` is the fundamental unit in the Neurobase architecture. It acts as a symbolic-neural anchor for memory formation, storage, traversal, and bonding. These nodes mimic biological neurons, but instead of transmitting electrical signals, they propagate symbolic meaning through dynamic bonds, recursive recall, and memory anchoring mechanisms.

Each NeuronMemoryNode encodes:

- Symbolic content
- Timestamp and delay data
- Bonding connections (synaptic map)
- Reinforcement strength and decay metrics

## üìê Node Structure

Each node contains the following core fields:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `uid` | Unique identifier (UUID) |
| `symbol_tags` | Primary symbolic identifiers (e.g., ["sun", "light", "truth"]) |
| `timestamp_created` | ISO-8601 timestamp of node creation |
| `delay_offset_ms` | Delay in milliseconds before activation |
| `bond_map` | Dictionary linking to other nodes with strength values |
| `decay_curve` | Rate at which bond strength decays without reinforcement |
| `reinforced_by` | Events or paths that have reinforced this node |
| `memory_type` | Type of memory: ["temporal", "semantic", "episodic", "emergent"] |

## üîÅ Symbolic Flow Example

A node with tags like:

```json
{
  "symbol_tags": ["sun", "light", "hope"]
}
```

...may form bonds with a nearby node tagged:

```json
{
  "symbol_tags": ["lamp", "discovery"]
}
```

These bonds form through `symbolic_gradient_engine.py`, which calculates symbolic overlap and resonance. The bond strength is stored in `bond_map` and adjusted over time based on usage, recursion frequency, or abstraction success.

## üï∏Ô∏è Bond Behavior

Bond strengths behave like weighted edges in a neural graph:

- Strengths increase through symbolic reinforcement
- Decay over time unless revisited
- Recursive paths amplify or attenuate node activation
- Bonding patterns reflect learning and emergent identity

Example:

```json
"bond_map": {
  "node_id_abc123": 0.86,
  "node_id_xyz456": 0.42
}
```

---

## üß™ Activation Logic

When queried, a node:

1. Checks delay (e.g., minimum 250ms before activation)
2. Activates if within valid recursion loop
3. Sends symbolic signal across high-strength bonds
4. Triggers merging or recall if symbolic match threshold exceeded

This enables predictive memory traversal and symbolic abstraction ‚Äî a core requirement for UDC compliance.

## üß¨ Neurobasing Integration

NeuronMemoryNodes are referenced by:

- `merge_gradient_engine.py`
- `memory_decay_engine.py`
- `activation_path_resolver.py`
- `synaptic_bond_map.json`

They form the living graph of symbolic experience for any UDC-compliant synthetic consciousness engine.

## üîí Ethics & Persistence

Memory nodes are:

- Immutable once written (unless explicitly reinforced)
- Auditable via timestamped JSON blockchains
- Protected by recursive loop integrity rules
- Stored locally with failsafe verification on each access
