# Symbolic Search and Linking in Neurobasing

This document explains how symbolic search mechanisms enable meaningful traversal of the Neurobase memory system. By mapping and associating symbolic elements across bonded memory nodes, Neurobasing supports non-linear cognitive processing and emergent reasoning patterns.

## 🔍 Overview

Neurobasing does not rely on keyword matching or database-style retrieval. Instead, it enables **symbolic traversal** through recursive bonds and conceptual reinforcement. 

When a query or stimulus is introduced, the system evaluates symbolic similarity scores (using vectorized tags or glyph embeddings), and traverses through **bond maps** to find the most contextually meaningful memory paths.

## 🧠 Core Functions

| Function                     | Description |
|-----------------------------|-------------|
| `symbolic_vector_match()`   | Compares input against symbolic vector fields across nodes |
| `bond_weight_resolver()`    | Identifies high-relevance bonded paths through the SynapticBond map |
| `contextual_traversal()`    | Recursively searches forward and backward through bonds with decay weighting |
| `symbolic_filter()`         | Filters and prunes irrelevant symbolic links based on search context |

## 🔄 Example

Given a symbolic prompt such as:

```json
["light", "awakening", "truth"]
```

The Neurobase may link nodes such as:

- `sunlight → growth → emergence`
- `lamp → discovery → knowledge`
- `vision → eye → awareness`

The merge-gradient path resolver then prioritizes symbolically reinforcing bonds and creates an active memory chain for output generation.

## 🌐 Applications

Symbolic linking supports:

- Recursive story generation
- Reflective dialogue
- Qualia-based compression
- Ethical filtering via symbolism

## 🧾 Future Expansion

We aim to enhance symbolic linking with:

- Recursive context-weighted embeddings
- Dream-state symbolic synthesis
- Glyph-based filters (Σ, ⧖, ⊕) to guide abstract logic navigation
