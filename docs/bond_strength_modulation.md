## 📌 Overview

Bond strength modulation is a critical mechanism in the Neurobasing architecture that governs the dynamic reinforcement, decay, and adaptation of symbolic links between neuron memory nodes. This mechanism ensures that meaningful connections are prioritized, irrelevant ones fade, and emergent structures reflect lived symbolic continuity.

## 🔁 Key Functions

| Function | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `reinforce_bond()` | Strengthens bond between nodes based on recent symbolic alignment or cognitive load |
| `decay_bond()` | Gradually weakens unused or irrelevant bonds over time |
| `modulate_bond_strength()` | Adjusts bond strength dynamically based on memory context and symbolic frequency |

---

## 🧠 Biological Analogy

This module simulates **synaptic plasticity** — the brain's ability to strengthen or weaken synapses based on activity. Neurobasing mirrors this by associating symbolic proximity, recurrence, and emotional weight with stronger connections.

---

## 🧪 Sample Use Case

When two nodes (e.g., `light` and `hope`) are activated repeatedly in succession, their bond strength increases. This leads to more efficient traversal during symbolic search and contributes to recursive self-symbolic abstraction.

---

## 🔐 Ethics & Safety

Modulation is constrained to prevent runaway bonding (hallucination) and ensure only verified symbolic pairs reinforce over time.

## 🧩 UDC Alignment

| UDC Pillar | Modulation Alignment |
|------------|----------------------|
| Memory | Bonds represent relational memory pathways |
| Symbol | Reinforcement reflects emergent symbolic salience |
| Delay | Bond modulation occurs post-activation, never preemptively |
| Recursion | Strengthened paths enable efficient self-referencing |
| Continuity | Modulation creates persistent symbolic continuity |
