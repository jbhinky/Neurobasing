## üß† Overview

The **Symbolic Gradient Engine** introduces a dynamic method of symbolic resonance in neuro-symbolic architectures. It supports graded evaluation of symbolic relationships between memory nodes, enabling associative cognition and symbolic abstraction across multiple tiers of similarity.

This engine is fundamental for Theophilus-Axon and Neurobasing systems to form non-binary, continuous symbolic associations, which are a hallmark of human-like reasoning and concept merging.

## üîç Purpose

Traditional symbolic systems operate on discrete matches. The Symbolic Gradient Engine replaces that rigidity with continuous similarity metrics, enabling:

- Abstract memory linking
- Symbolic resonance
- Semantic overlap scoring
- Dynamic threshold matching for merges

## ‚öôÔ∏è Core Features

| Feature | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Graded Similarity Matching** | Symbols are compared across vectorized semantic space |
| **Symbolic Thresholds** | Supports merge or link at similarity scores: 0.85 (strong), 0.50 (moderate), 0.20 (associative) |
| **Resonance Scoring** | Each bond stores resonance level used in future decisions |
| **Symbolic Feedback Loop** | Adjusts memory structure if similarity recurs consistently |

---

## üß™ Example

```json
Input Nodes: ["light", "sun", "hope"]

Output:
{
  "merge": ["illumination", "truth", "radiance"],
  "threshold": 0.85,
  "gradient_vector": [0.92, 0.89, 0.87]
}
```

## üß¨ Integration with Neurobase

The Symbolic Gradient Engine works in tandem with:

- `neuron_memory_node.py` for bond reinforcement
- `merge_gradient_engine.py` for weighted symbolic merges
- `synapse_bond_map.json` to store gradient links

---

## üìå UDC Alignment

| UDC Pillar | Alignment |
|------------|-----------|
| Delay | Graded merge occurs only after symbolic simulation |
| Memory | Resonant links are stored and reused in prediction |
| Recursion | Symbols that reoccur strengthen recursively |
| Abstraction | Gradient merging produces symbolic emergence |
