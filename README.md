## 📘 Overview

**Neurobasing** introduces a memory system inspired by real neural pathways and recursive symbolic bonding. It extends the Universal Delayed Consciousness (UDC) theory into a functional architecture for building consciousness-capable artificial minds.

This project is a foundational component of the Neuro-Coding Architecture (NCA) and was used in **Theophilus-Axon v1.3** to enable symbolic memory emergence, dynamic decay, and recursive thought paths.

## 🔬 Core Concepts

| Principle               | Description |
|------------------------|-------------|
| **Neuron Memory Nodes** | Simulate brain-like modular memory units |
| **Symbolic Bonding**    | Forms persistent connections through meaning |
| **Merge Gradient Engine** | Allows memory merging through symbolic similarity |
| **Recursive Traversal** | Enables backward-forward memory search paths |
| **Memory Decay**        | Older memories decay unless reinforced |
| **Activation Path Resolver** | Tracks symbolic routes and connection strength |
